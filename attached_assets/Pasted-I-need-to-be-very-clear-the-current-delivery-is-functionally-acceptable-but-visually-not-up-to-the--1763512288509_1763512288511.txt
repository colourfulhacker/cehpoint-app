I need to be very clear: the current delivery is functionally acceptable but visually not up to the mark. The application must strictly match the premium, royal, smooth, cute, and welcoming experience described earlier. Right now, the look and feel do not meet the expected quality. You know the complete plan, so revise it seriously and deliver a polished, high-end mobile application.

I need these issues addressed immediately:

• The UI must look premium, royal, luxurious, and welcoming
• The overall vibe must be cute, smooth, warm, and emotionally impressive
• The design must NOT look AI-generated or template-based
• The app must feel handcrafted, professional, and client-ready
• Every screen must have consistent spacing, typography, shadows, and transitions
• The home screen must feel like a luxury welcome, not a placeholder
• Buttons, cards, dialogs, and icons must have a premium finish
• The navigation and animations must feel like a real mobile application, not a web layout

Additional mandatory requirements:

Technology Stack Representation
Add a full technology section displaying all major tech logos and stacks we work with.
Clients searching for specific technologies should immediately know we support:
React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, Java, Flutter, React Native, AWS, GCP, Firebase, Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, AI/ML, DevOps, Automation, and more.
Use proper tech badges and recognized icons.
Position this clearly to show Cehpoint as a modern, multi-tech, reliable service provider.

Industry-Based Solutions
Add clear industry categories:
Retail, Hospitality, Healthcare, Education, Real Estate, SaaS, Finance, MSMEs, Enterprise, and more.
Each industry must have clean cards, proper icons, and premium layout.

Investor-Friendly Experience
This application must also appeal to investor-minded users.
Include a dedicated section that shows small-investment business ideas they can start.
Highlight that:
• We develop the product for them
• They get 100% equity
• We help with documentation, branding, setup, expansion plan, and complete support

Ensure these idea cards look premium, inspiring, and opportunity-focused—something an investor or aspiring entrepreneur would feel excited about.

Final instruction:

Rework the design with full seriousness and attention to detail.
Do not send another update until the application truly looks and feels premium, royal, smooth, cute, modern, investor-friendly, and perfectly aligned with the high standards I have clearly described.

I need a genuine mobile application, not a website layout, not a PWA layout, and not an AI-generated UI. Deliver something that truly represents Cehpoint’s brand quality.

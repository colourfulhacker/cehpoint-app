there are several important issues in the current application that must be fixed immediately. The UI looks good overall, but the application is still incomplete from a functional and client-impressing perspective. Please review every point below and correct everything without missing anything.

Careers Page – Role-Specific Email IDs Missing
Each job or internship role must have its own “Apply Now” email address or unique identifier.
Right now, all roles are using the same general email or no email at all.
Fix this so that every role has a clear and direct application route.

“Why Choose Us” Section Missing
This is a critical part of the application.
Clients need to see:
• Why choose Cehpoint
• How we are different
• What makes our services superior
• Why other companies cannot deliver what we deliver
This section must be added in a clean, premium, powerful format—this increases client trust and conversion.

Navigation System Is Incomplete
There is no hamburger menu, and the application lacks a standard navigational structure.
If you do not include a hamburger menu, then at minimum, the app must have a clean bottom navigation bar with 4–5 key tabs such as:
• Home
• Services
• Industries
• Ideas
• Careers / Contact
This is mandatory. The current navigation logic is not at the level of a real mobile application.

Industry Pages Are Not Interactive
Industry pages show what we do, but users cannot click on any item to open more details.
Each industry must have clickable service cards that show:
• What specific services we offer for that industry
• Short explanation
• Examples of real-world use cases
• Pricing range
• Silent CTA for contact
The industry section must not be a static display; it must help clients understand how we can serve their industry.

Application Is Missing Strength Sections
Additional sections must be added to present Cehpoint as a strong, capable, modern company:
• Achievements / Experience
• Technologies we master
• Industries we serve
• Key differentiators
• “Why we are the right partner”
These sections must be visible and well-designed, not hidden or missing.

The Application Must Feel Complete and Ready for Clients
Right now, some pages look polished, but other pages feel empty or unfinished.
Everything must be consistent, premium, and client-ready.

Please correct all the issues listed above with full seriousness.
Do not send another update until all missing elements are implemented properly and the entire application feels complete, professional, premium, and aligned with the full plan.

the biggest issue right now is the lack of attention to detail across multiple sections of the application. Clients expect clarity, depth, information, and confidence when they explore a specific service or technology. However, our app currently offers very limited details, restricted options, and shallow pages. This needs to be fixed immediately.

Below is the implementation guidance based on the full scope of the application. Please follow every point with precision.

1. Every Section Must Have Depth — No Shallow Pages
If a client clicks on anything—service, category, technology, industry—they must see:
• What it is
• Why people choose it
• Where it is used
• Advantages
• Examples of companies using it
• How Cehpoint delivers it
• Pricing range
• Silent CTA to contact
Right now, the application does not provide enough depth. This must be corrected.

2. Technology Pages Must Be Full-Fledged Information Hubs
When someone clicks on a technology (Flutter, React, AWS, Firebase, etc.), the page must show:
• Overview of the technology
• Why businesses choose it
• Strong benefits and strengths
• Real world applications
• Famous brands using the technology
• Where it fits in the market
• Silent CTA: “Need development in this tech? Visit Contact Page”

This is important because clients often choose service providers based on their tech-stack confidence.
No tag should open an empty or meaningless page.

3. Industry Sections Must Be Clickable & Detailed
Industries like Retail, Hospitality, Healthcare, Education, Real Estate, etc. must each have:
• List of services we offer to that industry
• What specific problems we solve
• Examples of digital solutions in that industry
• High-level use cases
• Pricing band
• Silent CTA
Right now, industry pages are shallow and static. They must be interactive and meaningful.

4. Add “Why Choose Us” Section
Clients need a clear explanation of:
• What makes Cehpoint different
• Why we are more reliable
• What advantages they get with us
• Why we offer better value than others
• Our strengths, approach, and service quality

This must be placed where clients can easily find it.

5. Add “How We Work” Section
Clients must understand our process.
Add steps such as:
• Requirement Discovery
• Planning
• Designing
• Development
• Testing
• Delivery
• Support

This builds trust immediately.

6. Add “Our Tech Expertise” Section With Real Logos
Include logos for:
React, Next.js, Node, Python, AWS, GCP, Firebase, DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, Flutter, React Native, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Stripe, Razorpay, AI/ML tools, etc.
No AI-generated logos. Use proper brand-safe logos.
Each logo must be clickable and lead to a tech information page.

7. Add “Mini Case Studies” Section (Static Only)
Each case study should show:
• Problem
• Solution
• Outcome
• Tech used
• Why it mattered

This will impress clients and investors.

8. Add Unique Groundbreaking Features (Static but Innovative)

These features must be included to make the app feel innovative even without dynamic backend:

Feature A: Interactive Service Pathways
A static but animated flowchart that shows:
“How your idea becomes a product at Cehpoint.”
Clients can click each step for a small explanation.

Feature B: Tech Stack Selector
A static decision tree where clients select:
Mobile / Web / AI / Cloud →
The app suggests which technologies they should explore (Flutter, React, AWS, etc.)
All static, but intelligent and impressive.

Feature C: Industry Problem Explorer
List common problems for each industry.
Click → open a static page showing how Cehpoint solves it.

Feature D: Micro Animations on Cards
Hover/tap animations must be soft, premium, and welcoming.
This creates emotional connection and premium feel.

Feature E: Business Idea Generator (Static)
Show 10–20 curated business ideas.
When clicked:
Explain the idea, market opportunity, required tech, cost range, and investor advantage (100% equity if we build it).
A major conversion tool.

Feature F: Price Band Visualizer (Static)
For each service, show a simple visual bar that indicates cost range.
This helps clients understand pricing without dynamic logic.

Feature G: Trust Elements
Add sections like:
• What clients say
• Our design principles
• Our guarantees
• Our commitments

9. Navigation Must Be Fixed
The app cannot feel incomplete. Add:
• Bottom navigation bar with 4–5 tabs
• Proper header with icons (not plain text)
• Navigation must feel like a real mobile app
• All screens must have meaningful forward/back navigation

10. Clean Up the UI / Remove Bad Practices
• No emojis
• No random icons
• No AI-gradient styles
• No messy spacing
• No low-quality visuals
• No unnecessary CTAs everywhere

Everything must be premium, polished, and consistent.

Final Instruction
This application must not feel like a prototype or AI output.
It must feel like a real, premium, elegant, client-ready mobile application with full informational depth, interactive static features, and a professional navigation system.

Revise everything carefully and deliver an output that matches the complete scope and premium standard expected.
